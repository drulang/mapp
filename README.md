#Mapp

Create a iOS application with the following features:

* Over an Apple or Google SDK map, display a single input field, into which a user
can type a combination of "what" and "where" information, such as "donuts near
717 Madison Ave", "pizza san francisco", or "chase bank 90210".
* Determine from the user's query: 1) "what" they want, and 2) the
latitude/longitude of where they are searching based on the center of the map.
* Make a request to the Citymaps Search API. A sample endpoint can be found
below.
* List the “name” and “category” of the resulting JSON response in an overlay.
* Show a “map” control to plot the search results using a the chosen mapping API..
* Use any additional libraries or services you deem appropriate to assist you.
Take no more than 3 hours to work on this, then send in your code via email or GitHub.
